				<h3>“My website is a shifting house next to a river of knowledge. What could yours be?”</h3>
				
				<p>I have just come across an article “My website is a shifting house next to a river of knowledge. What could yours be?” which is written by “Laurel Schwulst” who is a profound Designer, Artist and Writer.</p>

				<p>This article tells a lot about website, its development process with its endless possibilities in a quite comprehensive way. I would say that it is an achievement of a writer to explain the concept and technical terms of website metaphorically which served all of its audiences an equal experience while reading and understanding, be it a beginner or a maestro in web designing.</p>

				<p>She compared website with the real life entities like room, shelf, plant, garden, puddle etc which helps the readers/designers to think atypically about what is website actually and to open the doors of imagination to drive unseen designing ideas into reality and how it can be made purposeful for its users because it requires toil to achieve a look on intangible objects through hundred lines of codes.
                She even has made her article effortless for its readers to apprehend obscure website terminologies by giving its brief overview with the help of examples.</p>

                <p>Thus, in short, if anyone is clueless or a noob in this vast domain then this article must be in their reading list so that they can get encouraged, think expansively and experience a whole new poetic potential about making websites.</p>
