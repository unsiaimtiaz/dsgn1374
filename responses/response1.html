				<h2>“The Web Designer Exploring the Humanity and Humor of the Internet”</h2>
				
				<p>So this article “The Web Designer Exploring the Humanity and Humor of the Internet” is about a New-York based web designer Jon Lucas who has worked with a slew of arts and culture clients ranging from PIN-UP Magazine and the Berlin Biennale to Helmut Lang and RISD. It encourages Lucas’s ideas about creating simple yet hypnotizing websites structures by injecting humor and humanity through highlighting his remarkable works to set as an example.</p>

				<p>According to the article, Lucas believes that it is always important to keep things in a simple and casual way so that they  would not become a hard burdened job and can be remembered for a long time. He follows the same recipe in his profession also and always prefer raw styling in web designing which makes him enjoying his job as a hobby. For him, web designing is more about seeing through the websites and to know the intentions of the artistic creator no matter how it looks complicated on the front end.
                The article mentioned few of his successful projects which were based on the same technique but still stands out in a crowd which supports the idea of simplicity in web designing.
                </p>

                <p>One can surely agree to the author about easiness in designing but I would slightly oppose as things have much changed and become fast and complex which has also changed user’s requirements and expectations. Sometimes web designer doesn’t think about its own perceptions and ideas but what his/her user demands which lead him/her to complications. So it has become really hard to maintain balance between a simple good design and a complex user requirements when there are endless possibilities available in this domain. It takes time to achieve Lucas’s level where both user and designer can play in their comfort zones</p>
